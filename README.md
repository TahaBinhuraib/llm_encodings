# FastAPI Application with Sentence Transformers and Pinecone

This repository contains a FastAPI application that utilizes Sentence Transformers for text encoding and Pinecone for text retrieval. Sentence Transformers is a Python library for state-of-the-art sentence, paragraph, and image embeddings, while Pinecone is a vector similarity search engine.

The application allows you to encode text using pre-trained models from Sentence Transformers and store the embeddings in Pinecone. You can then perform similarity searches on the stored embeddings using Pinecone's search functionality.

## Requirements

To run the application, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- FastAPI
- Sentence Transformers
- Pinecone
